# SKU_SpreadsheetBuilder

At my current contracting job (eCommerce Database Analyst), I build out a spreadsheet every time our SKU numbers don't match up as we need to make sure that our SKU numbers on our website match the numbers we have on Oracle's Netsuite Application. I'm quite tired of manually building this spreadsheet out so I'm employing Python to assist me. 

The steps we need to take to build this spreadsheet are as follows:

2.
... TODO: Fill these out

Future Features: 
  - Have the script find where the ID's don't match, and shift the cells accordingly until they all match so you literally have to do zero work besides running the script.

Worries:
  - Not sure if I can pull all of the data I need. TODO: Research.
